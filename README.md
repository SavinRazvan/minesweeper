## Project: Minesweeper AI

### Overview
This project involves developing an AI to play Minesweeper, utilizing propositional logic and knowledge-based inference to identify safe cells and mines. The AI will learn from the game's state to make informed decisions.

### Key Components
1. **Minesweeper Class**: Manages game logic and the board.
2. **Sentence Class**: Represents logical sentences about the game, including sets of cells and mine counts.
3. **MinesweeperAI Class**: Implements the AI logic, using a knowledge base to make moves and infer safe cells or mines.

### How to Run the Game
To run the game, execute the main script `minesweeper.py` in your terminal or command prompt. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
